# E-commerce Project

## Overview

This application is a comprehensive system designed to handle order processing, payment, and delivery management across multiple components, each representing a distinct service: `Store`, `Bank`, `DeliveryCo`, and `EmailService`. The system includes fault tolerance mechanisms, asynchronous messaging with message queues, server-sent events (SSE) for real-time updates, and a React frontend for user interaction.

## System Architecture

The application is split into four core services:

1. **Store**: Manages order creation, payment requests, and delivery requests. Includes both frontend and backend functionalities.
2. **Bank**: Processes payment transfers.
3. **DeliveryCo**: Manages the delivery process, including status updates and randomised success/failure handling.
4. **EmailService**: Sends notifications to customers regarding order and delivery status.

Each service has its own database for data integrity and operates independently, with asynchronous communication managed by a customised PostgreSQL-based message queue.

## Components

1. **Frontend**: A React application running on `localhost:3000` to enable customer interactions, such as placing and monitoring orders.
2. **Backend Services**:
   - Store Service (`localhost:8083`)
   - Bank Service (`localhost:8084`)
   - DeliveryCo Service (`localhost:8085`)
   - EmailService (`localhost:8086`)

These components communicate via RESTful APIs, message queues, and SSE for real-time updates.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java 17
- Node.js and npm
- PostgreSQL

### Installation Steps

1. **IDE and Database Management Tool Set-up**:
   - Suggest using IntelliJ and PgAdmin to run the program for better installation

2.**Backend Services Setup**:
   - Start the PgAdmin application, and create a database call with the following set-up:
   ```bash
   Database port: 5432
   Database name: comp5348gp
   Database username: postgres
   Database password: 123456
   ```
   - In this Database, run the create_mq_table.sql PostgreSQL script in the following directory to initiate the Message Queue
     ```bash
     ./Source Code/create_mq_table.sql
     ```
   - In this Database, run the intert_warehouse_stock.sql PostgreSQL script int he folloing directory to insert the stocks to the warehouse database
   ```bash
     ./Source Code/intert_warehouse_stock.sql
   ```
   
3.**Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
   - Install dependencies and start the React application:
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm start
     ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend Services**:
   - Run each of the applications of `Store`, `Bank`, `DeliveryCo`, `EmailService` in IntelliJ to start the system

2. **Start the Frontend**:
   - From the `frontend` directory, run:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

### Store Service
- **User Login**: Allows customer login.
- **Order Management**: Place new orders, cancel orders, and check order status.
- **Payment and Delivery Requests**: Sends requests to the Bank and DeliveryCo for payment and delivery processing.
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses SSE to push updates from the backend to the frontend.

### Bank Service
- **Payment Processing**: Handles payment requests and updates order status.

### DeliveryCo Service
- **Delivery Management**: Processes delivery requests with a randomised 95% success rate.

### EmailService
- **Notification**: Sends email notifications to customers about their order and delivery status.
